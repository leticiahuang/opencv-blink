#### Summary
This is a blink-detection application wrote with OpenCV using Python. User is recorded by their camera and application will sound an alert when user blinks.


#### Background
* I have been seeing many applications people made online with OpenCV and thought it was very cool. 
* I wanted to learn how to use it myself and wrote this blinking-detection program with the help of this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eye-blink-detection-with-opencv-python-and-dlib/). 
* This project taught me the basic pattern behind computer vision and I also learned some OpenCV functions. It was super fun and insightful to code!


#### To Run On Your Computer
```
git clone
python3.8 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt
python3 main.py
```

###### Note
I have adjusted the time adjustments for what qualifies as a blink: fully closed for about one full second.
